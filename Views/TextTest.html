        Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima (locally: [ʁoˈnawðu ˈlwiʒ nɐˈzaɾju dʒ ˈɫĩmɐ]; born 18 September 1976[2]), commonly known as Ronaldo, is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a striker. Popularly dubbed "The Phenomenon," he is widely considered to be one of the greatest football players of all time.[3][4][5][6][7] A three-time FIFA World Player of the Year and two-time Ballon d'Or recipient, Ronaldo, in his 1990s prime, was known for his dribbling at speed, feints and clinical finishing.
         He was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004, and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame and the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

        Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals, and is the second-highest goalscorer for his national team, trailing only Pelé. At age 17, Ronaldo was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup.
         At the 1998 World Cup, he received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament in helping Brazil reach the final where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before the defeat to France. He won a second World Cup in 2002 where he starred in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. Ronaldo scored twice in the final, and received the Golden Boot as tournament's top goalscorer. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored his 15th World Cup goal, which was a World Cup record at the time.

        At his physical peak in the 1990s, at club level Ronaldo starred for Cruzeiro and PSV before he broke the world transfer record twice before his 21st birthday in signing for Barcelona followed by Inter Milan; this saw him become the second player after Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice. 
        At age 23 he had scored over 200 goals for club and country. After almost three years of inactivity due to serious knee injuries and recuperation, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002, which was followed by spells at A.C. Milan and Corinthians. Having suffered further injuries, Ronaldo retired from professional football in 2011, concluding an 18-year career. Post-retirement, he has continued his work as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador, a position to which he was appointed in 2000.[8] He served as an ambassador for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
